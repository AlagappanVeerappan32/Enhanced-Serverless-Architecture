# Enhanced-Serverless-Architecture

Enhanced Serverless Architecture for Cloud Application: This repository presents the enhanced architecture and improvements made to an existing cloud application. Building upon the foundation developed by Shathish Annamalai, Gandhi Rajan Mahendran, and Khusboo Patel, this repository showcases a complete serverless architecture that enhances the application's performance and scalability.

## Overview

Welcome to the Enhanced Serverless Architecture repository. This project documents the transformation of an initial cloud application architecture into a powerful and scalable serverless setup. The enhancements have been designed to optimize the application's performance, increase its efficiency, and provide seamless scalability, all while staying true to the core functionalities and principles.

### Previous Architecture

The original application was developed by Shathish Annamalai, Gandhi Rajan Mahendran, and Khusboo Patel. The foundation of this architecture laid the groundwork for subsequent improvements. Figure 1 in the report illustrates the initial architecture.
